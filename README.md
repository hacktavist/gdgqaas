GDGQAAS-GDG Quotes as a Service
===============================

A new contender for FOAAS; This is the first phase of my ruby hw for training

The service takes the name of an employee and gives a random quote that the person has said

There are only 3 names in there right now: Nic, Ben, and Rick



## Set up

Needed

+ bundler

run `bundle install`

Dependencies are shotgun and sinatra if you don't want to use bundler, but you guys should already have these installed

##Quotes

I have not put together a compendium of quotes that you all say, so I need quotes from you guys
